# Dino: DIstributed deadliNe cOmputing

A multi-lingual attempt at ~bad anagrams~ prototyping distributed deadline computing.

## Getting started
Right now, the Python prototype is furthest along. We strongly recommend using a Python [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) using Python 3.6.

Run the following:
bash
```
cd python
python setup.py install
# Use pip install --editable . if you're a developer
```

You should be all set! Run the following to see options
bash
```
dino -h
```
